# I am a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research, Bangalore. 
# My current research lies at the intersection of computer systems and machine learning, with a focus on efficiency and scalability. Previously, my work primarily addressed improving the performance and reliability of cloud and distributed systems and improving scalability of Big-Data processing and Recommender Systems. 

# I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, MS in Computer Engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville and BE in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
# Prior to Adobe Research, I had spent time as research interns at Microsoft Research – Redmond, AT&T Research – New Jersey and Lawrence Livermore National Labs - Livermore. Even prior to that, I worked in Software Engineering roles at Intel, Santa Clara and Atrenta (now Synopsys) on new product development on Electronic Design Automation.
